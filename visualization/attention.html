about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations if the film makers had made a good movie even though unrelated to the book i wouldn't have been so disappointed unfortunately they did not the plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks the acting is wooden and the directorial efforts mundane oh yes the way the bow to their leader is pure <UNK> i suppose a nod of recognition is due for the animal <UNK> the wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles","<PAD> <PAD>

but with more soft porn and no wit this film is no exception it had situations so familiar i died from deja vu people sat on <UNK> spinning out clichés about sex and relationships check <UNK> versus cheating with some woman man who would never look twice in reality at some other woman man check porn the baddies <UNK> check some guy girl in it who happens to be the only reason you're watching this rubbish check the lesson seems to be when it doubt make a tired old sex comedy about people no one cares anything about in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand

could someone want i suggest this movie to anyone that wants to sit back and forget all the trouble in the world and have a good laugh even if the movie does not do well in the theaters it is sure to become a cult classic i do suggest anyone going to see the movie pick up the <UNK> first album because a lot of the jokes are made only funnier if you have heard the songs such as obsession with sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil the movie still is laughs even if you have not heard their music but the songs are so great you can't pass them up","hold up and the palace sets are truly breathtaking but it is the smaller scale details that lend this film its depth and richness offering a glimpse into the lifestyles of poor as well as its elite the docks <UNK> houses and <UNK> are as fascinating as <UNK> throne room while errors abound on the large scale most notably the <UNK> succession the details are more <UNK> researched than the vast majority of hollywood's films visually it's not without its flaws the interiors are often too overly lit and colourful to blend seamlessly with the exteriors nevertheless this is a movie that should be credited for being as audacious in the small as it is in the large tedious in parts absolutely overacted <UNK> yes both though might be a more apt description too long absolutely not i wished they had spent more time with experiences in the house of death and among the and less with his <UNK> with though historically inaccurate yes that too but so was shakespeare nobody <UNK> him for it i appreciate historical accuracy

before him uses the london symphony orchestra to boot br br largely forgotten these days and a critical and box office disaster in 1985 <UNK> if for no other reason should still be seen for anyone

techniques and acting skills but i have watched a good number of movies of various genres and for an average viewer i will highly recommend this movie the feel is very <UNK> and realistic though there are some melodramatic moments watch it to feel human lately haven't seen any movie which touches heart especially in hindi cinema the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns

was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts the script's deficiencies more than <UNK> the decent acting the only reason i watched this

see you wearing any pants in this equation br br overall i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously","is ponderous and gaudy the acting for the most part is terrible i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting but he must have been <UNK> when he saw the final cut of the movie john gielgud brief his appearance in the movie still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played <UNK> was handsome the guy who played <UNK> looked more like the traditional depictions of <UNK> and was certainly at odds with robert <UNK> picture of <UNK> the climactic assassination of <UNK> wife and child is inaccurate in

convincing men in rubber suits at any rate none of the acting is oscar material and the isle of man doesn't really double for boston very convincingly the plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel <UNK> of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of an all girls college campus thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims is utterly laughable however the movie does have its suspenseful moments there's a few <UNK> of nudity and semi nudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and

turn but i was wrong elisha cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to brian van holt he played the bad guy too well i mean he was sick sadistic and very cruel the back story between the brothers was good plus i liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die jon <UNK> was pretty good as the goofy best bud of <UNK> i liked how chad kind of cried when he found him dead it was better then just him being like whatever my buddy is dead who cares it showed how he

almost unrecognizable considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u s would order a navy lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers and report only to the president that it made it hard to appreciate

they don't even try to make it look realistic flash gordon who hardly resembles a fighter uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives guns and other weapons

there are more laughs in any episode of law and order than in the last man seriously br br too much of the characters' interaction just didn't seem to me to have any foundation and was therefore very unlikely unbelievable br br if it hadn't been for the almost gratuitous bikini shots well what can i say avoid this movie like the plague or tape it and just fast forward to the bikini shots do not
